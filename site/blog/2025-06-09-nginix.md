[Nginx](https://nginx.org) automatically creates
[ETag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/ETag)
headers for static files. But it does it in such a way that is suboptimal.

I'll explain why that is, and how the
[Nixpkgs distribution of Nginx](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/8c742e834fd39a9b912a9237b5a6453cb4ec222b/pkgs/servers/http/nginx/generic.nix)
does it better.

First, let's take a look at how
[Nginx sets Etags](https://github.com/nginx/nginx/blob/5b8a5c08ce28639e788734b2528faad70baa113c/src/http/ngx_http_core_module.c#L1681-L1716):

```c
// in ngx_http_set_etag @ src/http/ngx_http_core_module.c:1681

(((1)))
etag = ngx_list_push(&r->headers_out.headers); (((1)))
if (etag == NULL) {
    return NGX_ERROR;
}

(((2)))
etag->hash = 1;
etag->next = NULL;
ngx_str_set(&etag->key, "ETag");

(((3)))
etag->value.data = ngx_pnalloc(r->pool, NGX_OFF_T_LEN + NGX_TIME_T_LEN + 3);
if (etag->value.data == NULL) {
    etag->hash = 0;
    return NGX_ERROR;
}

(((4)))
etag->value.len = ngx_sprintf(etag->value.data, "\"%xT-%xO\"",
                              r->headers_out.last_modified_time,
                              r->headers_out.content_length_n)
                  - etag->value.data;
```

1. Here we create an empty header entry in the requests's outgoing headers.

2. We initialize it, and set its key to "ETag".

3. We then allocate memory for the ETag value from the current request's arena.
   The size is calculated to be large enough to hold the timestamp
   (`NGX_TIME_T_LEN`), the content length (`NGX_OFF_T_LEN`), and extra
   characters (two quotes " and a hyphen -).

4. And then we fill the header's value to a string like `"5f7e1b2a-1c8f"` using
   the last modified time of the file being served and its content length.
   Something weird is `- etag->value.data`, which is required because
   `ngx_sprintf` returns a pointer to the end of the string. We do it to get the
   start.

Result: The outgoing request now contains an `Etag` header, which is based off
of the file's length and last modified date.

## But wait...

What if we use a tool that aims to produce
[reproducible build artifacts](https://reproducible-builds.org/) to build our
website, and we just so happen to modify a file in such a way that doesn't
change the size of its contents? (more common than you think)

> For example:
> Nix[^[A hermetic, declarative, reproducible and input(and soon content)-addressed build system.](https://nix.dev/)],
> which _always_ sets the last-modified timestamps for files under the Nix
> store[^The place Nix stores all build results, _usually_ `/nix/store`. Every
> "Nix store path" is represented like so:
> `/nix/store/6bxcxc6xvg5xv70z55adcwhgik5m41a0-package-1.0.0`, where the hash is
> derived from its inputs] to `1`, which corresponds to January 1st, 1970,
> 00:00:01 UTC.

In that case, neither the last modified date or the content length would change.
So the `ETag` header would stay **constant, which would make the client assume
the asset has not changed**.

## Silently Broken

The caching on your website being silently broken is a monumental issue, and has
to be fixed. The way Nixpkgs does it is through
[this patch:](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/8c742e834fd39a9b912a9237b5a6453cb4ec222b/pkgs/servers/http/nginx/nix-etag-1.15.4.patch)

```patch
This patch makes it possible to serve static content from Nix store paths, by
using the hash of the store path for the ETag header.

     r->headers_out.etag = etag;
```

The way this works is as follows:

1. The old logic, explained above is deleted.

2. We create 4 new variables, 3 used for path manipulation and 1 for storing
   `errno`.

3. Save the current value of `errno` (ugh) to a local.

4. Then we try to resolve `clcf->root.data`. `clcf->root.data` is the path
   specified in the root directive of the Nginx configuration and could be a
   symbolic link (e.g., it could be `/var/www` which might be a symlink to a Nix
   store path[^Please don't do this.]). `ngx_realpath` resolves all symbolic
   links and returns the canonical, absolute path. This is necessary to reliably
   check if the path is inside the Nix store.

5. Restore the value of `errno`, as the previous function call might have
   changed it. We handle the error case of `ngx_realpath` later.

6. These are **Nix placeholders**, aka they get replaced by the path of the Nix
   store at build time. The reason we do not hardcode `/nix/store` is because
   [Nix's store path, when on the local filesystem, is arbitrary](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.29/store/store-path.html#store-directory).
   This makes our patch portable.

7. **The main condition:** We check if the `r->headers_out.last_modified_time`
   is `1`, which is what Nix sets file's last modified times to, we then check
   if the canonical path resolution has succeeded (`real != NULL`), if the
   canonical path starts with the Nix store path (`NIX_STORE_DIR`), and if the
   store path has anything after it (`@[next] != '/' && @[next + 1] != NULL`).

8. (If the condition is true) We then extract the hash. A path like
   `/nix/store/6bxcxc6xvg5xv70z55adcwhgik5m41a0-package-1.0.0/bin/package` gets
   turned into `6bxcxc6xvg5xv70z55adcwhgik5m41a0`.

9. (If the condition is true) _SIDENOTE:_ This is a nice hack for one of many
   design failures in C, this one being NULL-terminated strings. We just place a
   `0` byte at the index we want to end our string out for efficiency, instead
   of creating a copy.

10. (If the condition is false) We continue on with the old logic, as explained
    at the top.

We then set the value of the `ETag` header to `"{hash}-{content-length}"`, the
reason for the content length being explained in the comment in the patch:

> It is fine to serve different resources with the same Etag, but different
> representations of the same resource (eg the same file, but gzip-compressed)
> should have different Etags. Thus, we also append content-length, which should
> be different when the response is compressed

This way, by depending on the Nix store path instead of the last modification
date, we can serve files more reliably and with less[^No, not none. You can
still cause unreproducible builds with Nix and have the store path not change,
at least with input-addressed derivations (derivation = the smallest Nix build
unit).] issues.

I hope you learned something in this blog post, and perhaps a new way to
fingerprint Nginx installs :).
