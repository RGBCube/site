Hey.

I'm a systems programmer who loves functional programming and is trying to apply
ideals of it in certain areas. Currently I'm working on the
[Cab contextful-expression language](https://github.com/cull-os/carcass/tree/master/cab).

I plan on creating a build system that uses Cab to build anything and
everything, a universal build system. This includes Linux/Darwin/Windows
distributions, all under the same tool.

If you want to see what I ramble about, or contact me, follow either of these
links:

- [Blog](/blog/)
- [Dump](/dump/)
- [Contact](/contact/)

I am also present in other websites, such as
[GitHub](https://github.com/RGBCube) and [X](https://x.com/HSVSphere).
