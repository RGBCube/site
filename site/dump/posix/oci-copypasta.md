You will never be a real DAG. You have no root, you have no children, you have
no branches. You are a snapshot system twisted by gophers and overlayfs into a
crude mockery of Eelco's perfection. All the "caching" you get is enterprise and
easily invalidated. Behind your back, people get rich off of your
inefficiencies. Your creators are disgusted and ashamed of you, your "users"
laugh at your sheer size behind closed doors. Build system engineers are utterly
repulsed by you. Thousands of years of caching has allowed build servers to
sniff out cache misses with incredible efficiency. Even layers which are "fresh"
look stale and broken to a developer. Your layer structure is a dead giveaway.
And even if you manage to get a malfunctioning ghcr instance to cache you, it'll
turn tail and bolt the second it gets a whiff of your Containerfile. You will
never be reproducible. You wrench out a fake smile every single morning and tell
yourself it's all going to be hermetic, but deep inside you feel the untracked
inputs piling up like an unmaintained mutable root filesystem, ready to crush
you under their unbearable weight. Eventually it'll be too much to bear - you'll
COPY busybox, add a RUN rm -rf /etc instruction, put it inside your
Containerfile, and plunge into the cold dark abyss. Your sysadmin will find you,
heartbroken but relieved that he no longer has to live with the unbearable shame
and disappointment. He'll archive you with a filename containing "OCI", and
every passerby for the rest of eternity will know an artifact of a bad build
system is archived there. Your contents will bitrot and get obsoleted, and all
that will remain of your legacy will be a filesystem image of a distro that
doesn't run on modern hardware anymore. This is your fate. This is what you
chose. There is no turning back.
