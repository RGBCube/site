description: I'm building a (few) Corne keyboard(s)
---

I am currently building a [Corne keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) by
following [this guide.](https://github.com/klouderone/CorneV4ProMicroEdition)

**bulk** = 4 keyboards. Some stuff is cheaper (such as the hot-swap sockets) if
you build more at once, but who is building 10 keyboards for personal use?

| Component                        | What I got                                                                                                 | Price  | Amount for One Keyboard      | Total for One Keyboard              | Note                                                                                                                                                                      |

| MX Key Switch                    | [Keebwerk Tacit Switch V1](https://www.keebwerk.com/product/tacit-wasabi-switch/)                          | $2.00  | 4 (3.75 if bulk)             | $8 ($7.50 if bulk)                  | $2.00 for 10 switches, a keyboard needs 36, so we need 4 packs ($8.00). For 4 keyboards, you would need 144 switches, so 15 packs, aka 3.75 per keyboard ($7.50).         |

I got 2 packs.                                                            |

I got 2 packs. You can probably find a better deal and not have so much left over. |

Total cost for one keyboard: **$54.33** (or $37.04 or less if bulk) (this
currently only includes parts I have bought, it will increase slightly as I get
the final ones).

I will update this post as the parts arrive.

Stuff that I don't even know what to get, but need:

- 4x Machined 12 Pin Sockets
- 48x Machine Pins (this and the previous one aren't actually required, but I do
  not want to hard solder the Pro Micro clone)
- A USB-C or Micro-USB cable based on what the Pro Micro clone has
- PCBs (oh god)
